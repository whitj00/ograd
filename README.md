# OGrad

OGrad is a teensy autograd engine that supports backpropogation and training. The project is an implementation Andrej Karpathy's [Micrograd engine](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd) in OCaml, drawing heavily from Karpathy's [Neural Networks: Zero to Hero](https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html) course.

A small example of training is included in `bin/main.ml`.
